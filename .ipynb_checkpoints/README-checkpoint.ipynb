    "In this project I implemented a PID controller to steer an autonomous driving car around a track in a simulator. The code is written in C++. This work is part of the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program at Udacity.\n",

There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).\n",

    "1. Clone this repo.\n",
    "2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
    "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`\n",
    "4. Run it: `./pid`. \n",

    " \\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in our project, we take the negative value of the cross track error (CTE) as error \"e(t)\". The proportional part of the control law make the vehicle turns when it is away from the center of the road. The derivative term provides a better damping so it steers gracefully, while the integral term helps to reduce the steady state error of the system. In this project, we need to tune the parameters kp,kd and ki either manually or automatically.  The following data are what I tuned for this project, which worked well.  And also, I impletemented the PID controller for both steering angle and speed of the car in the simulator.  I chose manual method, following the idea of the twiddle algorithm. \n",
